# Pediatric-Perimeter
Pediatric Perimeter is a project undertaken at the Engineering the Eye Workshop organized by Srujana Innovation Center, LVPEI and MIT Media Lab. The project's aim is to automatically acknowledge a child's reaction to a visual stimuli provided in the Pediatric Perimeter device.
This repo contains a Segmentation algorithm deployed in Pediatric Perimeter, being developed by Srujana Innovation Center, MIT Media Labs and LVPEI Hospital, to track gaze (pupil tracking) of babies in real-time using Viola-Jones Face Detection algorithm and Fast Radial Symmetry Transform.
